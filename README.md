# user-api

This is the api that I will be using for Users.
The longterm goal is to have:
1 api for authentication
1 api for data management
1 api for email notifications
1 api for frontend work

I will put the queries.js in a separate file with restrictive permissions but for the basic intorduction of this code I will keep it within the users-api folder. Plus I have much to learn about that!
